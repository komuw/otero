# The Collector consists of three components that access telemetry data:
# (a) Receivers
# (b) Processors
# (c) Exporters
# (d) Extensions(optional)
# These components once configured must be enabled via pipelines within the service section.
#
# Receivers -> Processors -> Exporters

# (a) Receivers
# A receiver, which can be push or pull based, is how data gets into the Collector
# https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/README.md

receivers:

  # Data sources: traces, metrics, logs
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 # It is important that we do not use localhost
        tls:
          # insecure: false
          cert_file: /etc/tls/server.crt
          key_file: /etc/tls/server.key
          ca_file: /etc/tls/rootCA.crt        # For a client this verifies the server certificate. For a server this verifies client certificates. If empty uses system root CA.
          client_ca_file: /etc/tls/rootCA.crt #  Path to the TLS cert to use by the server to verify a client certificate.
      # http:

# (b) Processors
# Processors are run on data between being received and being exported. Processors are optional though some are recommended.
# https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/README.md

processors:

  # Data sources: traces, metrics, logs
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 10s
    limit_percentage: 50
    spike_limit_percentage: 30

  # Data sources: traces, metrics, logs
  batch: # batching helps better compress the data and reduce the number of outgoing connections
    send_batch_size: 8192 # Number of spans, metric data points, or log records after which a batch will be sent regardless of the timeout.
    timeout: 10s # Time duration after which a batch will be sent regardless of size.

# (c) Exporters
# An exporter, which can be push or pull based, is how you send data to one or more destinations.
# The list of all exporters(that can be used in collector config) is found;
# https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?s=exporter&language=collector
# https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter

exporters:
  # Data sources: traces, metrics, logs
  file/mine: # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/fileexporter
    path: /etc/otel_file_exporter.json
    rotation:
      max_megabytes: 100 # max size in megabytes b4 rotation.
      max_backups: 2
      localtime: true
    format: json

  # Data sources: traces, metrics, logs
  # logging:
  #   loglevel: debug

  # Data sources: traces, metrics, logs
  # otlp/some-custom-name:
  #   endpoint: otel_collector:4317
  #   headers:
  #     header1: "header-value1"

  # Data sources: traces, metrics
  # jaeger is deprecated and removed as an exporter.
  # see: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/2858
  # Instead, it can now speak native otlp protocol. See next section.
  # jaeger:

  # Data sources: traces, metrics, logs
  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: "jaeger:4317"
    tls:
      # insecure: false
      cert_file: /etc/tls/server.crt
      key_file: /etc/tls/server.key
      ca_file: /etc/tls/rootCA.crt        # For a client this verifies the server certificate. For a server this verifies client certificates. If empty uses system root CA.

  # Data sources: metrics
  prometheus: # configure OpenTelemetry Collector to export data to Prometheus
    endpoint: "otel_collector:9464"


# (d) Connectors
# Connectors join two pipelines, acting as both exporter and receiver.
# A connector consumes data as an exporter at the end of one pipeline and emits data as a receiver at the beginning of another pipeline.

# (e) Extensions
# Extensions are available primarily for tasks that do not involve processing telemetry data
# They are optional

extensions:
  zpages: # Enables an HTTP endpoint with data for debugging different components that were properly instrumented for such.

# (f) Service
# The service section is used to configure what components are enabled in the Collector based on the configuration found in the receivers, processors, exporters, and extensions sections.
# If a component is configured, but not defined within the service section then it is not enabled. 
#  The service section consists of three sub-sections:
# - extensions
# - pipelines
# - telemetry

service:
  extensions: [zpages]
  # A pipeline consists of a set of receivers, processors and exporters.
  # pipeline can be of the following types: traces, metrics, logs
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [file/mine, otlp/jaeger]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [file/mine, prometheus]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [file/mine]
  # telemetry: # Telemetry is where the telemetry for the collector itself can be configured.
